# ScrapBook
ScrapBook is a library for scraping Facebook. It is meant to be used as a normal Facebook API without access tokens nor App Secrets. The data it accesses is not limited by any API.

It uses my library 'Universal Web Scraper', including all of the libraries inside it. (https://github.com/miguelangelo78/Universal-Web-Scraper)
